      Mary Slessor — a woman whose courage, compassion, and unwavering
      dedication left an indelible mark on our nation's history. At a time when
      fear and superstition endangered the lives of innocent children, she stood
      boldly for justice, challenging harmful traditions and advocating for the
      voiceless. <br/> Slessor did not just preach change; she lived among us,
      learned our languages, respected our cultures, and earned our trust. In
      Calabar and beyond, she became more than a missionary — she became a
      mother, a judge, a teacher, and a beacon of hope. Her legacy lives on in
      the values of compassion, equality, and education that continue to shape
      communities today. We remember her not only as a Scottish woman but as one
      of our own — a true Nigerian in spirit and heart. <br/> Her legacy continue
      to inspire generations to come!
